Faint echoes of distant footsteps reverberate through the empty air, and the occasional rustle of wind moves trash across the cracked asphalt. Faded, weather-worn storefronts line either side, their windows long since shattered or boarded up, and the once-bustling area now feels eerily quiet. The faint scent of decay lingers, and the hum of the city seems distant here, as though even the streets have given up on the idea of normalcy. This part of town feels abandoned, despite the few people wandering by.",
